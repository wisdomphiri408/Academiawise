    <strong>Can Lead to Unfair judgements:</strong>
    intuition makes us belive in something even though it might be wrong. This can lead to poor judgement. For example research says that people act differently in different environments. Some of us strongly believe that those people who smoke are smokers because they are evil, which might not be true, it might depend on external factors like social pressure and stress.
